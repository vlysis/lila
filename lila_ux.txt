1. Core Principle for Mobile
Logging should feel like naming an experience, not filling a form.
So:
no keyboards by default
no durations unless asked
no stacked menus
Mode + Orientation chosen in one gesture each

2. The Atomic Interaction: “Log a Moment”
Entry point
Floating “+” button
Or long-press from lock screen (later)
Tap → Log Sheet slides up (bottom sheet, not full screen)




3. Step 1: Choose Mode (primary, first)
Mode is the meaning of the activity, so it comes first.
Visual design
Four large, calm buttons
Icon + word
Muted, earthy colors (no gamification energy)
Layout (2×2 grid):

[ 🌱 Nourishment ]   [ 🌿 Growth ]
[ 🔧 Maintenance ]  [ 🌫 Drift ]
Interaction:
Single tap selects
Selection animates gently (expand / glow)
Haptic tick (subtle)
Time so far: ~300ms

4. Step 2: Choose Orientation (secondary, lighter)
Once a Mode is tapped, Orientation appears immediately underneath.


Orientation selector
A 3-way segmented control:

[ Self ]   [ Mutual ]   [ Other ]
Design notes:
Neutral colors
No icons initially (words matter here)
Default can be last-used (but always visible)
Tap once → done.
Time so far: ~600ms total

5. Optional Layer: Name the Activity (optional, skippable)
Only now does text appear—and it’s optional.
Placeholder: “What was it?”
Voice input encouraged
Or tap a recent activity chip
Recent chips example:

[ Walk ] [ Email ] [ Reading ] [ Scrolling ]
If the user does nothing here → still logged.
This keeps honesty > completeness.

6. Duration: Never First, Sometimes Later
Default duration behavior:
Implicit (Lila estimates later)
Or last-used duration per activity
Or quick presets if tapped
If shown at all:

[ Short ] [ Medium ] [ Long ]
Not minutes. Never minutes by default.

7. The Entire Flow (compressed)
Tap + → Tap Mode → Tap Orientation → (Optionally name it) → Auto-save & dismiss
No “Save” button. No confirmation dialog. Trust the action.

8. Ultra-Fast Variant: “Quick Log”
For Drift especially, speed matters.
Long-press + shows:
A radial menu:


Inner ring: ModesOuter ring (appears on hold): Orientations
Slide → release → logged.
This is optional, but power users will love it.

9. Gentle Reflection Inline (not blocking)
After logging, a one-line whisper may appear:
“Mostly Other-directed so far today.”
“First Nourishment logged today.”
“Drift late again—noticed.”
No actions required. Disappears automatically.

10. How This Maps to Markdown (invisibly)
Each log becomes a bullet like:

- **Reading**  
  mode:: growth  
  orientation:: self
The user never sees this on mobile—but it’s always there.

11. Accessibility & Emotional Safety
Important details:
Large tap targets (thumb-first)
No red / green success cues
Drift visually equal to other modes
Orientation language never framed as “selfish” vs “good”
This is a confessional interface, not a dashboard.
